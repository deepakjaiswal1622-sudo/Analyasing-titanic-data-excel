Report: Titanic Dataset Survival Analysis (Foundational)
# Executive Summary

This project analyzes the Titanic Dataset to provide foundational insights into passenger demographics and survival rates. Using Microsoft Excel, we extracted key quantitative data points related to survival, age, and passenger class (Pclass) fares. The core finding is the clear disparity in outcomes and expenditure based on socioeconomic standing.


# Project Overview
This project uses the historical Titanic Dataset to establish baseline statistics regarding survival and passenger attributes. The analysis focuses on core metrics derived directly from the data to inform deeper investigations, addressing the immediate questions of survival count, average age of survivors, and fare distribution.


# Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including:

•	PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

•	Survived: Survival status (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).

•	Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

•	Name: Passenger's full name.

•	Sex: Passenger's gender.

•	Age: Passenger's age.

•	SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.

•	Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.

•	Fare: The fare paid.

•	Embarked: Port of embarkation.


# Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

•	Analyze the overall survival rate and the total number of survivors versus non-survivors.

•	Investigate the relationship between age and survival by calculating the average age of those who survived.

•	Determine the average fare paid across different passenger classes (Pclass) as an initial measure of socioeconomic influence.


# Key Business Questions

1.	 Find total Fare revenue generated by each Embarked port.

2.	Find the average Age of passengers for each Pclass.

3.	Count the number of survivors (Survived = 1) who were traveling 'Alone' versus 'With Family.'
   

# Tools & Techniques

•	Microsoft Excel

o	Formulas: Used for calculating sums, averages, and counts (e.g., SUMIF, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF).

o	Pivot Tables: Crucially utilized to group, summarize, and calculate averages or counts across single categorical fields.

o	Calculations: Direct computation to find aggregates.
Deliverables

•	A summary report detailing the initial findings.

•	Tables summarizing survival counts and average fares by class.

# Insights (Sample Findings)
The initial findings confirm the scale of the disaster and the correlation between cost (Fare) and accommodation (Pclass):

•	Survival Count:

o	Total Survived Passengers: 342

o	Total Non-Survived Passengers: 549

•	Survivor Age: The average age of passengers who survived was approximately 28.55 years.

•	Average Fare by Class: Fare shows a steep decline from 1st to 3rd Class, highlighting a clear socioeconomic gradient:

o	1st Class: The average fare was $84.15.

o	2nd Class: The average fare was $20.66.

o	3rd Class: The average fare was $13.68.

o	The overall average fare paid across all classes was $32.20.

# Future Enhancements

The next steps for the project should involve deeper correlational analysis:

•	Use Pivot Chart visualizations to display the differences in survival rates by Gender and Pclass.

•	Create Age Bands (e.g., Child, Adult, Senior) to segment survival data beyond a single average age.

•	Analyze the impact of Family Size (SibSp + Parch) on survival probability.

•	Develop an interactive Excel dashboard combining all these metrics.
